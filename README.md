# SLAM-v3
SLAM v3 is a high-precision multimodal transformer designed for local execution, prioritizing accuracy over efficiency. It processes text and image inputs through four parallel encoder paths, fuses outputs via dense attention, and decodes with MLA-enhanced attention. Itâ€™s computationally intensive but optimized for top-tier performance.
